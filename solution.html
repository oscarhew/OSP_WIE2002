                    Policies that promote equity can help, directly and
                    indirectly, to reduce poverty. When incomes are more evenly
                    distributed, fewer individuals fall below the poverty line.
                    Equity-enhancing policies, particularly such investment in
                    human capital as education, can, in the long run, boost
                    economic growth, which, in turn, has been shown to alleviate
                    poverty.

                    The housing situation in many countries is characterized by
                    significant disparities, with a large percentage of renters
                    experiencing housing insecurity and cost-burdened. People of
                    color and those with disabilities are particularly
                    vulnerable to housing insecurity and discrimination in
                    obtaining and maintaining housing. Homelessness is a
                    significant issue, with chronic homelessness on the rise.
                    Investments in permanent housing programs and renter
                    protections, such as a right to counsel and regulating the
                    use of background checks, can help address these issues and
                    promote more inclusive communities.

                    Congress must raise the federal minimum wage, which has not
                    been increased in more than a decade and is currently just
                    $7.25 per hour. This is not enough to keep workers out of
                    poverty, and the subminimum wage for tipped and disabled
                    workers only exacerbates the problem. The Raise the Wage Act
                    proposes a gradual increase to $15 per hour by 2025 and
                    indexing it to median wage growth thereafter. It also phases
                    out subminimum wages for tipped, teenage, and disabled
                    workers. These changes would lift millions out of poverty
                    and disproportionately benefit marginalized communities.

                    To build a more equitable economy, federal investment is
                    needed to create new jobs through initiatives such as the
                    American Jobs Plan, which proposes investing $2.3 trillion
                    in areas such as green energy, caregiving, domestic
                    manufacturing, and infrastructure. The plan aims to provide
                    decent wages and benefits and make these jobs accessible to
                    all Americans. If passed, it could help rebuild the economy
                    and address the gap of 7.6 million jobs lost since February
                    2020, promoting financial security and savings for the

                    The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the inadequacies of
                    America's safety net programs. Unemployment insurance (UI)
                    and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) have
                    not been able to provide sufficient support to those in
                    need. While temporary federal expansions have provided
                    relief, many governors are cutting benefits, leaving
                    millions in dire straits. The American Rescue Plan has made
                    progress in expanding food assistance programs but
                    eligibility for SNAP must be further expanded to include
                    excluded groups. Lawmakers must invest in and modernize
                    safety net programs and implement automatic triggers to
                    expand benefits during future economic shocks. This would
                    not only prevent people from falling into poverty but also
                    stimulate the economy by giving timely relief to those in
                    need
